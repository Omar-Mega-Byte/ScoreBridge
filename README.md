# ScoreBridge_HackNomics

> **AI-Driven Financial Reliability for the Invisible Economy**
> A fair credit scoring system for freelancers, gig workers, students, and underbanked communities.

## 🌍 Problem

Traditional credit scores are outdated and biased:

* Favor salaried employees with formal bank records
* Exclude millions who rely on gig income, cash flow, or mobile wallets
* Reinforce inequality by treating lack of history as high risk

**Result**: Freelancers, students, and underbanked populations are locked out of fair loans, housing, and essential financial services.

---

## 💡 Solution

**ScoreBridge** is an AI-powered financial scoring system that evaluates **real-world money habits**, not just credit cards or bank loans.

We analyze:

* ✅ On-time bill & rent payments
* ✅ Freelance & gig economy income history
* ✅ Mobile wallet & digital transactions
* ✅ Savings patterns & expense consistency

This creates a **transparent and fair creditworthiness score** that both lenders and users can trust.
