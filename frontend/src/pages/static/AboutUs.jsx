          <div className="prose max-w-none text-gray-600 leading-relaxed space-y-4">
            <p className="text-lg font-medium text-gray-700">
              ScoreBridge was born from a simple yet powerful observation: credit scores are often mysterious, 
              intimidating, and inaccessible for the average person. We set out to democratize financial literacy 
              and empower individuals with the tools they need to understand and improve their financial health.
            </p>
            <p>
              The journey began with extensive research into credit scoring methodologies. We developed our proprietary 
              <strong> ScoreBridge Index (SBI)</strong> credit scoring formula because of its comprehensive approach that 
              considers four critical dimensions: Payment History (P), Credit Utilization (I), Credit Mix & Age (T), 
              and Recent Credit Behavior (S). This formula provides a holistic view of an individual's creditworthiness, 
              ranging from 300 to 900 points.
            </p>
            <p>
              But we didn't stop at just implementing the formula. We enhanced it with cutting-edge machine learning 
              capabilities. Our team spent countless hours training and fine-tuning a Random Forest model using 
              diverse financial profiles, enabling us to not only calculate scores but also predict future trends 
              and provide intelligent recommendations. The ML engine analyzes thousands of data points to generate 
              personalized, actionable advice that's specific to each user's unique financial situation.
            </p>
            <p>
              What truly sets ScoreBridge apart is our unwavering commitment to transparency and education. Unlike 
              traditional credit bureaus that operate as black boxes, we show users exactly how their score is 
              calculated, breaking down each component with clear explanations. Our AI-powered recommendations don't 
              just tell you what to doâ€”they explain why it matters, how much impact it will have on your score, 
              and provide step-by-step action plans to help you succeed.
            </p>
            <p>
              The technical implementation showcases modern fintech architecture at its best. Omar architected and 
              developed the entire full-stack system: a robust Spring Boot backend with RESTful APIs, JWT authentication, 
              and H2 database integration; a responsive React frontend with beautiful visualizations using Recharts; 
              and comprehensive testing to ensure reliability. Shahd designed and trained the machine learning models, 
              implementing sophisticated feature engineering, recommendation algorithms, and the entire Python Flask 
              ML service that powers our AI capabilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a HackNomics 2025 competition project, ScoreBridge represents our vision for the future of fintech: 
              technology that's powerful yet accessible, intelligent yet transparent, and designed to truly help people 
              improve their financial lives. We're excited to showcase how AI and modern web technologies can work 
              together to solve real-world problems and make financial services more equitable for everyone.
